# Reflection

## Strengths:

### Placeholder
<br>

## Weaknesses:

### Time Complexity of code
The time complexity of both obfuscation functions each are roughly O(nÂ²), if not more, which can cause the runtime of our code to be too long when given lengthy c++ files to obfuscate.
<br>
## Future Changes:
- Improve the time complexity
- Include the ability to obfuscate on other high-level programming languages
